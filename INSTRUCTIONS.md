# Electricity Price API Challenge

In this challenge, you will build a web service that provides electricity
price information based on historical data.

We have uploaded a week's worth of half-hourly electricity prices for each state to a
CSV. Your task is to create a web API that allows clients to retrieve the
mean electricity price for a specific state.

Python/Typescript is preferred however feel free to use language you are most comfortable in

We expect this task to take approximately 2–3 hours. Please do not spend significantly longer than this.

## The Challenge

Your web API should:

* Access the provided data
* Run a web server with at least one endpoint that accepts a ``state`` argument and
calculates the mean price for that state
* Your submission should include a ``README.md`` with instructions on how to set up and run
the application

## Resources

* You may use any Python/JavaScript/TypeScript version that is not end of life
* You may use any web framework that you like
* You may use any additional packages/frameworks that you think are appropriate
* You are provided the data in the ``data/`` directory, which contains a CSV with three
columns:

  * ``state``: The state for which the model is run
  * ``price``: The price that is modelled
  * ``timestamp``: The start of the time period for which the price is modelled

## What We Are Assessing

This exercise is intended to assess your ability to:

* Write clean and maintainable code
* Build simple and well-structured web applications
* API Design
* Handle data ingestion and processing
* Follow best practices in testing, structure, and deployment

The dataset provided is small, but assume this service may eventually need to handle significantly larger datasets and higher request volumes. Design with this in mind where appropriate, but do not over-engineer.

## Submission

You may submit your application in two ways:

1. A link to a public Git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. An email that includes your repository as a zipfile
